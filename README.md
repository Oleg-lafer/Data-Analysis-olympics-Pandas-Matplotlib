# Tokyo 2020 Olympics Analysis

## Overview

This project delves into the data from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics to uncover interesting insights related to country performance, athlete demographics, and gender distribution in various sports. It utilizes the power of Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

## Project Goals

- Investigate if there's a correlation between a country's GDP and its overall success at the Olympics.
- Explore the participation levels of male and female athletes throughout the games.
- Analyze how athletes are distributed across different sports disciplines.
- Examine the gender balance within each discipline to identify any potential disparities.

## Data Sources

- **Project Folder Dataset:** This project utilizes a dataset that is already included within the project folder. This dataset contains information about athletes, teams, coaches, medals, and gender entries for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

## How to Run the Project

This project is designed to be executed within a Google Colab environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Open the Notebook:** Open the primary Jupyter notebook file (typically named 'Olympics_Analysis.ipynb') in Google Colab. This notebook contains all the code necessary for the analysis.

2. **Install Libraries:**
   - In a code cell within the notebook, run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
     `!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly wordcloud`

3. **Run the Analysis:**  
   - Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially. The code will load the dataset, perform calculations, and generate visualizations to address the project goals.

## Visualizations and Insights

The analysis generates various visualizations to illustrate the findings, including:

- **Scatter plots and regression lines:** To examine the relationship between GDP and Olympic medals won by different countries.
- **Pie charts:** To depict the overall gender distribution of athletes participating in the Olympics.
- **Bar charts:** To display the number of athletes in each sport, as well as the gender breakdown within each discipline.

To see the results of these visualizations and interpret the insights, execute the code in the notebook.


## Requirements

- **Google Colab account:** You'll need a Google account to access Google Colab.
